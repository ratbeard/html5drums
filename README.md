A drum tracker... in your browser?!?

**YES!**

Courtesy of jquery, the html5 `<audio>` tag, and browsers that implement it.  That would be:

- Safari >= 4
- Firefox >= 3.5
- Chrome >= nightly (???)
- Opera ???
- Internet Explorer - not known :(

Install
=======
Trust me:

    git clone git@github.com:ratbeard/html5drums.git
    cd html5drums
    open index.html  # on mac!

Thanks

1. _Brian Arnold_ - original idea and coded it up!
2. _God_ - for giving me strength (in my arms!)
