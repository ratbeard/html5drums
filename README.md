**YES**

Courtesy of jquery, jqueryUI, the html5 `<audio>` tag, and browsers that implement it.  That would be:

- Safari 4
- Firefox 3.5
- Chrome nightly (?)
- Opera (supports audio API, but not the audio tag ?)
- Internet Explorer 8 has no audio support whatsoever (barring _Silver-Light™_ and _Flash®-Technology_!)

More about the current audio capabilities of browsers:

    git clone git@github.com:ratbeard/html5drums.git
    cd html5drums
    open index.html  # on 
